BitNinja Server Security

### App Description
BitNinja is a general purpose security-as-a-service server defense tool powered by a social defense system and many active defense modules. Its main purpose is to protect your server with less effort and maintenance from you. BitNinja does its job silently in the dark and using powerful tools - just like a ninja :-) BitNinja fights against hackers, botnets, attackers, and malicious activities. All of the Ninja servers form a huge honey farm to collect and analyze attacks from different botnets and then use this knowledge to form an even harder shield for all the Ninja servers.
